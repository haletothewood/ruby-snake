Ruby Snake
==========

A snake game made with Ruby and the Gosu 2D game development library.  Adapted for use at Makers Academy with great thanks to the original developer [Joel Walden](https://github.com/joelwalden/ruby-snake)!  

What is Ruby?  Ruby is the friendliest and most enjoyable of programming languages!  It's the first language you learn on the Makers course.  It's a very powerful backend (that's the part of applications that the user doesn't see) and can also be used for some front-end (the part the user does see - think a webpage or your Microsoft Word screen) code as well.
